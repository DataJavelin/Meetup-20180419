## What is Data Science, AI & Machine learning?


### Data Science:
Making sense of the large volumes of data. 

* statistical knowledge (e.g. sampling, Bayesian inference etc)
* computing skills to implement algorithms (e.g. coding, cloud computing etc)

Note:
With the emergence of big data, data scientists have become more prevalent.
* They are the people that can work out what algorithms are suitable for the task and implement them.
* They need good statistical knowledge to understand nuances of data and what algorithms are appropriate
* They need good coding skills and competent with computing to implement them


### Artificial Intelligence
Recreate **intelligent** behaviour

Note:
AI means different things to different people

#### Conversationalist

Note:
Like HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey. 
Are we there? SIRI, amazon echo .. 
requires speech recognition, natural language understanding
Done in the cloud, requires massive training set
Can you actually have an in depth conversation?
