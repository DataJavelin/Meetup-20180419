## What is Data Science, AI & Machine learning?


### Data Science:
*Extracting information from Data*

* statistical knowledge (e.g. sampling, Bayesian inference etc)
* computing skills to implement algorithms (e.g. coding, cloud computing etc)

Note:
With the emergence of big data, data scientists have become more prevalent.
* They are the people that can work out what algorithms are suitable for the task and implement them.
* They need good statistical knowledge to understand nuances of data and what algorithms are appropriate
* They need good coding skills and competent with computing to implement them


### Artificial Intelligence
Recreate **intelligent** behaviour

Note:
AI means different things to different people


#### Conversationalist

Note:
Like HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey. 
Are we there? SIRI, amazon echo .. 
requires speech recognition, natural language understanding
Done in the cloud, requires massive training set
Can you actually have an in depth conversation?


#### Humanoid

Note:
e.g. replicants in blade runner, android in alien..
Are we there? making progress for example google's atlas project


#### Problem Solver

Note:
Historically, early AI pioneers were excited about computers playing games, carrying out logical tasks..
We can do that now. e.g. alphago, computer plays against itself to learn best strategy
But they are not generic problem solvers. Alphago will not do anything else


#### Big data learner

Note:
more recently the prediction, optimization, and recommendation systems have been given the term AI.
These systems use massive data sets, learn patterns from them, which are then used to provide 
predictions, provide optimised routes in google maps, or offer recommendations such as netflix.
It is this area in which machine learning is key..


### Machine learning
Toolbox of techniques behind data science and recent AI activity

Data + model + compute -> prediction

Note:
Observes a system, emulates it with complex mathematical functions.
advancements in computational power e.g. GPUs have allowed the use of more complex mathematical functions
