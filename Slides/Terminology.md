## What is Data Science, AI & Machine learning?


### Data Science:
Making sense of the large volumes of data:
Require:
* statistical knowledge (e.g. sampling, Bayesian inference etc)
* computing skills to implement algorithms (e.g. coding, cloud computing etc)

Note:
With the emergence of big data, data scientists have become more prevalent.
* They are the people that can work out what algorithms are suitable for the task and implement them.
* They need good statistical knowledge to understand nuances of data and what algorithms are appropriate
* They need good coding skills and competent with computing to implement them
