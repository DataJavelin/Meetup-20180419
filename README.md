## Speaker Notes

reveal.js comes with a speaker notes plugin which can be used to present per-slide notes in a separate browser window. The notes window also gives you a preview of the next upcoming slide so it may be helpful even if you haven't written any notes. Press the 's' key on your keyboard to open the notes window.

A speaker timer starts as soon as the speaker view is opened. You can reset it to 00:00:00 at any time by simply clicking/tapping on it.
